# Pulse Browser

An app I wrote to flex my frontend development skills and solve a problem I have: 
``` text
How do I organize the millions of photos I have spread across a thousand different storage mediums?
```

The initial concept for this app came when I most recently upgraded my computer. I now have a number of old machines with a hodgepodge of images, videos, documents, etc. I wanted to design a way for me to organize, tag, compare, and link these images with external services like Google Photos, Dropbox, etc.
